# MLSD - Social Media Sentiment Analysis and Trend Forecasting

This project focuses on using a large collection of tweets to predict their sentiment polarity (0 = negative, 4 = positive). By analyzing individual tweet sentiments, we aim to infer overall trends and gain insights into public opinion on various topics.

## Project Description

The idea behind this project is to leverage sentiment analysis to forecast trends in social media discussions. We plan to utilize a dataset of 1.6 million tweets (the Sentiment140 dataset) to train a model that predicts tweet polarity. Once we determine the polarity of each tweet, we will analyze the distribution and patterns of these sentiments to identify trends and significant shifts in public sentiment over time.

## Project Data

We will be using the [Sentiment140 dataset with 1.6 million tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140) available on Kaggle. This dataset consists of tweets published around 2009 and includes the following fields:
- **Tweet ID:** Unique identifier for each tweet.
- **Tweet Text:** The content of the tweet.
- **Date Published:** Timestamp of when the tweet was published.
- **Username:** Twitter handle of the tweet's author.
- **Query:** The query used to retrieve the tweet (if available).
- **Sentiment Score:** A manually annotated score indicating the sentiment (0 for negative, 4 for positive).


## Project Goals

Our primary goal is to develop a robust model capable of forecasting trends based on sentiment analysis. By predicting the polarity of tweets, we aim to extract meaningful insights that can be applied to several domains:

- **Real-time Trend Monitoring:** Detecting emerging topics and changes in public sentiment related to news, politics, etc.
- **Stock Market Insights:** Correlating sentiment trends with market movements to inform trading strategies.
- **Public Opinion Analysis:** Gaining an understanding of large-scale opinions on brands, political decisions, and other areas of interest.
- **Event Impact Analysis:** Analyzing how public sentiment evolves before, during, and after significant events such as elections or product launches.
